serviceDescription: "This Program contributes to a clean transportation system by increasing the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Canada through purchase incentives, as a means to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. More specifically, the Program is targeted towards increasing the adoption of these vehicles by middle-class Canadians, and does so by prioritizing incentives for the purchases of affordable ZEVs."
