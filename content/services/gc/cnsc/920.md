serviceDescription: "The transport of nuclear substances is a regulated activity in Canada, with CNSC licensees involved in the majority of shipments. In general, the transport of nuclear substances does not require a CNSC licence. The PTNSR 2015 require that licences be issued only in the circumstances listed above. The majority of these licences are issued for the transport of inâ€‘transit shipments (i.e., nuclear substances transiting Canada while being transported from one country to another) and for the transport of Category I, II and III nuclear material."
