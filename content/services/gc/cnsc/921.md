serviceDescription: "The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) established the Participant Funding Program (PFP) in 2011 to:
1. enhance individual, not-for-profit organization and Indigenous group participation in the CNSCâ€™s environmental assessment (EA) and licensing processes for major nuclear facilities (e.g., uranium mines, nuclear power plants, nuclear substance processing, or nuclear waste facilities).
2. assist individuals, not-for-profit organizations and Indigenous groups to bring value-added information to the Commission through informed and topic-specific interventions related to EAs and licensing (i.e., new, distinctive and relevant information that contributes to a better understanding of the anticipated effects of a project)."
