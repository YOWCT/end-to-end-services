serviceDescription: "Under the Government Employees Compensation Act  (GECA), provincial workersâ€™ compensation boards (WCBs) are responsible for adjudicating federal employee claims, providing benefits and services such as payment of medical expenses, wage replacement, and facilitating return to work arrangements with employers. The Labour Program receives and reviews all GECA claims and forwards authorized claims to the appropriate WCB. As set out in bilateral service agreements, WCBs invoice the FWCS for claim related costs plus a set administration fee. The Labour Program then recovers these costs from employers from which the claims occurred. The Labour Program also administers GECA claims for locally engaged staff who work outside of Canada as well as claims under the following: the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act; the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations; and the Public Servants Income Benefit Plan."
