serviceDescription: "EI provides temporary financial assistance to unemployed Canadians who have lost their job through no fault of their own, while they look for work or upgrade their skills.
Canadians who are sick, pregnant, or caring for a newborn or adopted child, as well as those who must care for a family member who is seriously ill with a significant risk of death or who must provide care or support to their critically ill or injured child  family member may also be assisted by EI. The program also allows for self-employed individuals to register into it for access to EI special benefits (sickness, maternity, parental, compassionate care and parents of critically ill children family caregiver benefits)."
