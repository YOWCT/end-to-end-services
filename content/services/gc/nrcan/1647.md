serviceDescription: "Amendments to the Explosives Regulations introduce a new requirement for all permit, factory licence, and magazine licence holders of types E (high), I (initiation systems), and D (military and law enforcement) explosives to undergo screening for the purposes of protecting persons, property, and the environment from harm and/or keeping dangerous substances secure.

Screening is for federal licence holders and their employees who will have unsupervised access to types E, I, and D explosives. These persons must submit the application form along with an original1 criminal record check to obtain an approval letter from the Explosives Regulatory Division (ERD). Alternate screening documents such as a Permis Général, FAST card, NEXUS card, or a Firearms Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) are considered to be an equivalent document to an approval letter."
