serviceDescription: "CanmetMINING evaluates the emission characteristics of new diesel engines destined for use in underground mines. This evaluation is conducted according to a strict Canadian Standards Association (CSA) protocol in order to determine the composition of toxic gases and particulate and calculate an Air Quality Index. This index is used to determine the amount of ventilation, i.e. clean dilution air required to use this engine in an underground mine. This number is required in most canadian provinces and territories (regulatory requirement) in order to use diesel equipment safely. Without this certification process, the mining industry in most cases is required to supply a \"penalty\" volume of sir which may be 2 to 3 times higher than would be required if the engine was certified. This leads to very high energy costs and is a serious concern for the industry and regulators."
