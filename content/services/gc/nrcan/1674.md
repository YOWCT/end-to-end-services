serviceDescription: "Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) helps improve the reliability of measurements at mineral analysis labs in Canada and around the world by certifying reference materials.  

Certified reference materials—Canadian ores, rocks, concentrates, tailings, soils, alloys, anodes and radioactive materials—are used as standards to validate analytical measurement methods or to calibrate analytical instruments used in analytical chemistry. These standards support decision-making around mineral resource production, commodity valuation and compliance with environmental regulations.

NRCan’s analysis and certification is conducted through its Canadian Certified Reference Materials Project (CCRMP). NRCan also provides more than 75 reference materials for purchase on its website."
