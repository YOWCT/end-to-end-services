serviceDescription: "For federally-regulated pipelines, when a landowner and a pipeline company cannot agree on compensation for lands that the company has acquired or damaged, either party may apply to the Minister of Natural Resources to receive the services of a negotiator, or to have the dispute settled by arbitration.  Services related to negotiation and arbitration are managed under the authority of the National Energy Board Act, via the Secretariat.  The Secretariat advertises for negotiators/arbitrators, screens/interviews candidates, recommends candidates for appointment by the Minister, briefs the Minister's Office, manages case documents and liaises with NRCan legal services."
