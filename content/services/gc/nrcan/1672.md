serviceDescription: "Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) manages the national program in Canada that certifies people who perform non-destructive testing (NDT).

NRCan’s National Non-Destructive Testing Certification Body (NDTCB) provides: Portable tube-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer operator certification.

The Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer operator certification program comprises radiation safety training and examination components that are based on the non-destructive testing method of radiographic testing.

The NRCan National Non-Destructive Certification Body (NDTCB) developed and implemented its XRF certification program in collaboration with Health Canada. Health Canada publishes safety codes that are incorporated into the Canada Labour Code, which applies to federally regulated sectors. An addendum specifically applicable to portable hand-held x-ray tubes based on open-beam XRF devices falls within the scope of Safety Code 32. It requires individuals who use “portable hand-held x-ray tube based open-beam XRF” devices to be certified."
