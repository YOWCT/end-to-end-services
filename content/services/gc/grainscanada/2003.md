serviceDescription: "Under the Canada Grain Act, grain producers are entitled to order producer railway cars through the Canadian Grain Commission to ship any grain designated as such under the Canada Grain Act. Producer railway cars are used to ship grain directly to destination and provide producers a delivery alternative to the licensed grain handling system. Producers have the option to deal directly with the Canadian Grain Commission and self-administer their cars or use an administrator who submits a completed producer car application on their behalf to the Canadian Grain Commission."
