serviceDescription: "Once the Agency receives a complete project description, it must consider whether or not an environmental assessment is required. During this determination, the public is provided with an opportunity to comment on the proposed project and its potential for causing adverse environmental effects. When it has been decided that an environmental assessment is required, the public is given an opportunity to comment on which aspects of the environment may be affected by the project and what should be examined during the environmental assessment. Once the proponent submits its environmental impact statement, the public is invited to comment on the identified potential environmental effects of the project and the measures to prevent or mitigate those effects as proposed by the proponent. At this stage, avenues for comment and additional opportunities to participate may include open houses or public meetings. Finally, the public is provided an opportunity to comment on the draft environmental assessment report. This document includes the Agency's conclusions regarding the potential environmental effects of the project, the mitigation measures that were considered and the significance of the remaining adverse environmental effects."
