serviceDescription: "Impact assessments (IA) may be substituted to another jurisdiction so that a single IA meets the legal requirements of the federal IA and of the other jurisdiction that has powers, duties or functions in relation to an assessment of the effects of a designated project. If the Minister is of the opinion that the provincial process is an appropriate substitute for an assessment under the Impact Assessment Act and that conditions contained in the Act regarding factors to be considered, public participation and the submission of an IA report will be fulfilled by the provincial process. The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change can allow a provincial process to substitute the federal IA process, but not federal decision-making. The Minister may establish additional conditions as a prerequisite to their approval of a substituted process. The Minister may also approve substitution with other jurisdictions, such as an Aboriginal land claim body."
