serviceDescription: "Once the Agency receives a complete initial project description, it must consider if an impact assessment (IA) is required. During this determination, the public has an opportunity to comment on the proposed project and its potential for causing effects. When it has been decided that an IA is required, the public has an opportunity to comment on which aspects of the environment may be affected by the project and what should be examined during the IA. Once the proponent submits its impact statement, the public is invited to comment on the identified potential effects of the project and the measures to prevent or mitigate those effects. Avenues for comment and additional opportunities to participate may include open houses or public meetings. Finally, the public has an opportunity to comment on the draft IA report and potential conditions. The IA report includes the Agency's conclusions regarding the potential effects of the project, the mitigation measures that were considered and the significance of the remaining adverse effects. The Potential conditions are then recommended to the Minister for inclusion in the project Decision Statement. The potential conditions include mitigation measures and follow-up programs that address the potential adverse effects within areas of federal jurisdiction as determined during the IA. Should the project be allowed to proceed, the Minister issues the Decision Statement including conditions which are legally binding on the proponent."
