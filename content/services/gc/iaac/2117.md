serviceDescription: "The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change may refer an impact assessment (IA) under the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) to a review panel if it is in the public interest to do so. To make this decision, the Minister must consider: (1) the extent to which the effects identified within federal jurisdiction are adverse; (2) public concerns related to those effects; (3) opportunities for cooperation with other jurisdictions; and (4) adverse impacts on the rights of the Indigenous peoples.  

A review panel is a group of independent experts appointed by the President of the Agency. The Terms of Reference for a review panel are established by the Minister. A review panel conducts an assessment of the potential impacts of a project. The Review Panel or Integrated Review Panel will conduct its analysis on the information and studies provided on the public record, including the Proponent's Impact Statement. The Review Panel or Integrated Review Panel will engage with the Proponent, federal departments, Indigenous groups, the public and other jurisdictions during the assessment. 

A Review Panel or Integrated Review Panel is required to hold a public hearing. The public hearing allows participants, including Indigenous groups, to present information, concerns and comments regarding the potential impacts of the designated project. The review panel prepares a report that includes its rationale, conclusions and recommendations and submits its report to the Minister."
