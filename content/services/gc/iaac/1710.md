serviceDescription: "The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change may refer an environmental assessment (EA) to a review panel if they are of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so. To make this decision, the Minister must consider: (1) if the project may cause significant adverse environmental effects; (2) if there are public concerns related to the significant adverse environmental effects; (3) if opportunities for cooperation with other jurisdictions exist. A review panel is a group of independent experts appointed by the Minister to conduct an EA. 

A review panel conducts an assessment of the potential adverse environmental effects of a designated project. The Review Panel will conduct its analysis of the information and studies provided on the public record, including the Proponent's Environmental Impact Statement. The Review Panel will engage with the Proponent, expert federal departments, Indigenous groups, the public and other jurisdictions, during the assessment. The Environmental Impact Statement is posted on the Registry and comments are invited on the document.

A review panel is required to hold a public hearing. The hearing allows participants, including Indigenous groups, to present information, concerns and comments regarding the potential environmental effects of the designated project. The review panel prepares a report that includes its rationale, conclusions and recommendations, and submits its report to the Minister."
