serviceDescription: "Environmental assessments (EA) may be coordinated so that a single EA meets the legal requirements of both jurisdictions. A responsible authority may delegate any part of an EA it is required to conduct to another jurisdiction. The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change must allow a provincial process to substitute for a federal EA to be conducted by the Agency, but not federal decision-making, if requested to do so by a province and if the Minister is of the opinion that the provincial process is an appropriate substitute for an assessment under CEAA2012 and that conditions contained in CEAA 2012 regarding factors to be considered, public participation and the submission of an EA report will all be fulfilled by the provincial process. The Minister may establish additional conditions as a prerequisite to their approval of a substituted process. The Minister may also approve substitution with other jurisdictions, such as an Aboriginal land claim body. Under the equivalency provisions of CEAA 2012, where a provincial process meets all of the conditions for the substitution of a process, the Minister may recommend to the Governor in Council that a designated project be exempted from the application of CEAA 2012."
