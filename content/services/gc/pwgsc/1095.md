It has recently also started producing statements and notifications for Phoenix, and notifications for the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
Plans are in place to migrate the print workload of Employment and Social Development Canada and of Veterans Affairs Canada, which is currently delivered by Shared Services Canada (SSC), to NPP.  By fiscal year-end, once that workload is fully migrated, it is anticipated to increase NPP's print volume by approximately 45%. High Volume Print-to-Mail Operations."
