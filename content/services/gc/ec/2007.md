serviceDescription: "This service provides timely and accurate information about ice in Canada's navigable waters to the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and mariners in support of safe and efficient navigation: information about icebergs for east coast Canadian waters south of 60N, ice climatology and tools, and an annual Atlas of winter Arctic Ice conditions. Daily ice forecasts and charts are provided where there is ice and known marine activity and contain information about ice concentration, ice edge, stage of development, floe size, drift velocity and with appropriate level of resolution. The Canadian Ice Service will ensure charts and forecasts are produced seven days a week with no interruption longer than 24 hours. This Advisory and Information Service is not a transactional e-service. The ice information is accessible online or via the CCG marine radio, or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) service for low bandwidth users, and is available instantly in a self-service manner: it does not require a user's account nor an application. A total of 6,710 ice forecasts and charts (3,990 ice hazard bulletins and 2,720 daily ice charts) were issued in 2019-20."
