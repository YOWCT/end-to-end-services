serviceDescription: "The National Hydrological Service (NHS) provides Canadian hydrometric data and information services to Canadians and their institutions on behalf of the National Hydrometric Program (NHP). These include near real-time Canadian hydrometric data 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and value-added historical Canadian hydrometric data and statistical information. NHP hydrometric data and information are used in flood risk management, emergency response management, water resources planning, water allocation, infrastructure planning and design, environmental monitoring and management, analysis of climate change and long-term weather effects, power generation, and recreational uses of waterways. This Advisory and Information Service is not a transactional e-service. It is information accessible online, available instantly in a self-service manner: it does not require a user's account nor an application.  For 2019-20, the WaterOffice website had a total of 66,277,536 page views and the Datamart data provision service had a total of 166,871,174 hydrometric data downloads."
