serviceDescription: "Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for issuing BC aquaculture licences for marine finfish, shellfish, freshwater (or land-based) and enhancement operations. 



BC aquaculture facilities must operate in compliance with key environmental and health legislation such as the Health of Animals Act, Food and Drugs Act, and Species at Risk Act. 



BC aquaculture licences define the responsibilities of operators and assure processors and consumers that they are buying seafood from a licensed facility. 



Licences are issued for the operation of a specific aquaculture site and licence holders must apply for a renewal at the frequency specified in the conditions of licence. Companies and organizations with multiple sites must obtain a separate licence for each site."
