serviceDescription: "The Divestiture Class Grant Program helps DFO dispose of recreational harbours and all derelict and low-activity harbours. These harbours are offered at nominal cost to other federal departments, provinces, municipalities, local non-profit organizations or First Nations. If there is no interest, the harbour is offered at market value. As a last resort, it is demolished. The Divestiture Class Grant Program provides those recipients who wish to acquire a harbour as soon as possible with a payment to accept the harbour \"as is\" in lieu of SCH undertaking any required repairs or improvements. The recipients are not obligated to use the payment for repairs and improvements. They must, however, assume full responsibility for the harbour and must keep the harbour open to the public for at least five years."
