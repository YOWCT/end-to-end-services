serviceDescription: "When a supplier or employer wants to be exempt from having to disclose confidential business information (CBI), such as the chemical identity of one or more trade-secret hazardous ingredients, they must file a claim for exemption with Health Canada. Once a complete application is received, a Hazardous Materials Information Review Act (HMIRA) Registry Number is assigned to the claim by Health Canada. The HMIRA Registry Number is required to be shown on the safety data sheets (SDSs) and for certain claims, on the label, for that product to be sold on the Canadian market or imported into Canada without disclosure of the CBI. - (HECSB)"
