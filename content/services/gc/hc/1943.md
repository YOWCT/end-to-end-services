serviceDescription: "The Cannabis Act and its regulations govern the applications for licences and permits. Only licensed parties under the Cannabis Regulations may import or export cannabis, and only for medical or scientific purposes. A permit is required for each individual shipment of cannabis and each permit application is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

The import and export provisions for cannabis operate in the context of Canada's international drug treaty obligations. Health Canada has an obligation to maintain control over the movement of cannabis in a manner consistent with these international drug control conventions which strictly limit trade in cannabis to medical and scientific purposes between countries within the International Narcotics Control Board's confirmed estimates.
