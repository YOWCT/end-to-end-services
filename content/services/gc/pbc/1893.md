serviceDescription: "The Royal Prerogative of Mercy (RPM) is a monarch's prerogative exercised in Canada by the Governor General or the Governor in Council. Clemency is granted in exceptional circumstances in deserving cases involving federal offences, where no other remedy exists in law to reduce severe negative effects of criminal sanctions. Clemency can be requested for numerous reasons, including employment, perceived inequity, medical conditions, immigration to Canada, compassion and financial hardship. The Governor General or the Governor in Council grants clemency upon the recommendation of a Minister of the Crown. In most cases it is the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness who makes the recommendation."
