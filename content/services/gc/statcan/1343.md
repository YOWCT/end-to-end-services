serviceDescription: "The Industrial Product Price Index is an important component of the quarterly estimates of the income and expenditure accounts including gross domestic product which is required by the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.   The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) measures price movements for products sold by manufacturers in Canada. The IPPI is used extensively by businesses for contract escalation and industry analysis. Statistics Canada uses this index to deflate current dollar values and derive estimates of real growth and productivity for the manufacturing sector."
