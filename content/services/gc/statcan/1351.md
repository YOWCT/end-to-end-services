serviceDescription: "The Census of Population Program outputs are used for a wide variety of purposes:
• Population estimates based on census counts determine how the federal government distributes billions of dollars in federal transfers annually to provinces and territories, including the Canadian health and social transfers, territorial financing and equalization payments.
• Population and dwelling counts support the delineation of federal electoral districts (and thereby representation in the House of Commons), and are the basis for estimates required by the Constitutional amending formula.
• Provincial governments and territories use census counts in determining transfers to regional and municipal governments, school boards and local agencies.  
• Information on Aboriginal peoples, visible minorities and women are required to administer the Employment Equity Act and its regulations and related programs.
• Information on mother tongue, home language and knowledge of official languages supports the application of the Official Languages Act"
