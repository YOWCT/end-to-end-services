serviceDescription: "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an indicator of changes in consumer prices experienced by Canadians. It is obtained by comparing, over time, the cost of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by consumers. Since the basket contains goods and services of unchanging or equivalent quantity and quality, the index reflects only pure price change. The CPI is widely used as an indicator of the change in the general level of consumer prices or the rate of inflation. The All-items CPI, various aggregate indexes as well as special aggregate indexes are produced and published each month for Canada, the provinces, Whitehorse, and Yellowknife. The All-item CPI and the shelter index are produced and published for sixteen cities. The monthly CPI series for the eight major aggregates and a few special aggregates at the Canada level are also available seasonally adjusted. Each year with the release of the December CPI data in January, annual average indexes are produced for all of the published monthly indexes. Inter-city indexes of price differentials of consumer goods and services are produced and published once a year for eleven cities. In addition to indexes year-over-year and monthly percent changes are disseminated for all published series. Finally, average retail prices for food and other selected items for Canada and average retail gasoline and fuel oil prices for eighteen cities  are estimated and published monthly."
