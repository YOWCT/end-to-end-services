serviceDescription: "The Balance of Payments (BOP) is a statistical statement that records all economic transactions between Canadian residents and non-residents during a specific period of time in two accounts, the current account and the capital and the financial account. Transactions recorded in the balance of payments statement represent the exchanges and transfers of economic values between Canadian residents and non-residents. The economic values exchanged or transferred can be goods, services, primary and secondary income or financial claims. Government relies on these statistics to help shape it's financial and trade policies. BOP statistics are also used extensively by businesses, the academic community, the media and the public at large for both informational and analytical purposes. Finally, they are needed to meet Canada's statistical obligations to supranational organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."
