serviceDescription: "The Research Data Centres (RDCs) provide researchers with access, in a secure university setting, to microdata from population and household surveys, administrative data holdings and linked data. The centres are staffed by Statistics Canada employees. They are operated under the provisions of the Statistics Act in accordance with all the confidentiality rules and are accessible only to researchers with approved projects who have been sworn in under the Statistics Act as 'deemed employees.' RDCs are located throughout the country, so researchers do not need to travel to Ottawa to access Statistics Canada microdata."
