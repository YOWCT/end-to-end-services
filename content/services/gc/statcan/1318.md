serviceDescription: "At the core of the gross domestic product by income and by expenditure is the concept of gross domestic product and its components. It is a measure of aggregate economic activity that represents the unduplicated value of production in two ways: (i) incomes arising from production and (ii) final expenditures on production. The first is the sum of factor incomes generated by productive activity-that is, incomes representing the returns to the labour and capital employed. The second is the sum of all sales to final users (consumers, governments, business on capital account, exports less imports). The two measures of gross domestic product may not be equal to each other, giving rise to a statistical discrepancy."
