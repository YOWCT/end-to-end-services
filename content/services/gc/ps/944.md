serviceDescription: "The Passenger Protect Recourse Office processes requests for recourse submitted by those individuals who have been denied boarding under the Passenger Protect Program. Everyone who is denied boarding because of the Passenger Protect Program receives a written notification from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness notifying them about their rights to request recourse for their denial. Only those who receive this letter can submit a request—within 60 days of being denied boarding—to remove their name from the Secure Air Travel Act list."
