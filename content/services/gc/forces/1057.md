serviceDescription: "The Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Program helps to manage risks posed by UXO on Legacy Sites across the country and thereby contributes to the health and safety of Canadians. 
Legacy Sites are former military sites across Canada. Many of them were used for training and weapons testing during conflicts such as the world wars and the Korean War. A UXO legacy site is any property that was owned, leased or used by the Department of National Defence (DND) for military purposes. These properties are no longer a part of the departmentâ€™s inventory, but could still present a UXO-related risk to the public.
The Program identifies and catalogues such sites, assesses risks, and works to reduce UXO risk through property controls, assessment surveys, UXO clearance operations, and public education."
