serviceDescription: "As part of its audience-development strategy, the NFB makes its rich film collection accessible to partners across the country such as community centres, public libraries, arts centres (“Maisons de la culture”) and non-profit organizations seeking to host public screenings of specific NFB titles or seasonal programs of films. Through this service, the NFB provides a digital file or DVD copy of the film(s) requested, as well as promotional material. Examples of partners using this service include Canada’s public libraries (through the NFB film club program), the not-for-profit entity Fondation canadienne pour le dialogue des cultures, responsible for organizing the yearly Rendez-vous de la Francophonie cultural event, and community centres wishing to screen titles from the NFB’s collection of indigenous-made works. 
Public screenings are part of our community-gathering initiative, and they offer a way for the NFB to promote its works and facilitate dialogue around them, while reaching a broad segment of the population."
