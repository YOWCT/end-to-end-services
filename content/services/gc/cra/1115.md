Online filing is available when a trustâ€™s taxable income, tax payable, and refundable credits are $0.00. Otherwise, a trust income tax return must be filed via paper. CRA provides the information necessary for the taxpayer to file, processes the return and issues a paper notice that reflect the assessment results. Debit notices will include a request for payment and credit notices will include a refund. CRA and/or client-initiated reassessments may occur."
