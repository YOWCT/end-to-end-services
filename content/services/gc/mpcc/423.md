serviceDescription: "Any person, whether they are a civilian or a member of the military and whether or not they were affected, may complain about the conduct of Military Police (MP) in the performance of “policing duties or functions.”

To help ensure an effective and fair investigation, it is desirable that complaints be made in as timely a manner as circumstances permit (Note: there is a one-year deadline, subject to reasonable extension on application to the Chair of the Commission). Persons considering making a complaint should know that they are not required to provide evidence in support of their allegations when filing complaints. 

The Complaints about the Conduct of Members of the Military Police Regulations state that any of the following constitute “policing duties or functions”:
•the conduct of an investigation;
•the rendering of assistance to the public;
•the execution of a warrant or another judicial process;
•the handling of evidence;
•the laying of a charge;
•attendance at a judicial proceeding;
•the enforcement of laws;
•responding to a complaint; and
•the arrest or custody of a person.

It should be noted that the regulations specifically exclude from the description of policing duties or functions “a duty or function performed by a member of the military police that relates to administration, training, or military operations that result from established military custom or practice.”"
