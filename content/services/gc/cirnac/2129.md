serviceDescription: "The Indigenous Art Centre at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) is responsible for the development, preservation and promotion of the Indigenous Art Collection. The Collection represents works of art by Canadian First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis artists. The collection of over 4,900 works includes regional representation from prominent, mid-career and emerging artists of all major art media forms.  The Art Centre lends artwork for exhibitions at arts and cultural institutions, including art galleries and museums across Canada and internationally. The Art Centre also manages an active, bi-annual national acquisition program. During each nation-wide call for submissions, hundreds of works are reviewed by an Indigenous-led peer-jury comprised of members of the Indigenous arts community."
