serviceDescription: "The objective of the Federal Interlocutor's Contribution Program is to help to build capacity, and to maintain a relationship based on trust and respect between off-reserve Métis and Non-Status Indian people and the Government of Canada. This is achieved by: maintaining political relations with their representative organizations; acting as the point of contact within the federal government; acting as an advocate of their issues within Cabinet; entering into contribution agreements to help to build organizational and institutional capacity; and, building stronger linkages with provincial governments.

In order to achieve these objectives, the Program supports work with Métis, non-status Indian and off-reserve Aboriginal organizations towards:

* achieving practical ways of improving Métis and non-status Indians socio-economic conditions,
* increasing self-reliance, and
* reducing dependency."
