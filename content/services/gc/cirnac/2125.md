Their input will be used to shape policy and programs, resulting in better, more effective, policies and programs that are easier to implement and respond to community needs and structures.
It is intended that contributions for consultation and policy development will achieve the following outcomes:
*Active engagement of Status Indians, Innu and Inuit, their Bands, communities and organizations in the development of the government's legislative and policy agendas for Indigenous Peoples;
*Better informed Aboriginal organizations, their supporting members, elected officials, as their input to departmental staff;
*Increased understanding by all stakeholders of the issues;
*Broader understanding of the government's intentions towards Aboriginals;
*Increased support and acceptance of government legislation and policy based on the input received from the Aboriginal community and their organizations; and
*Improvement in the relations between status Indians, Inuit and Innu and the federal government."
