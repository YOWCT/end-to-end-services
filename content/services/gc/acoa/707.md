serviceDescription: "Economic development in rural areas is challenged by the decline of traditional industries, population shifts and infrastructure issues. There is a need to support initiatives through strategic planning activities related to economic development of geographic regions and sectors of interest. ACOA works with Atlantic Canadian communities to make strategic investments that increase human capacity in the community, including:  skills development, SME ownership by target groups, training and coordination as well as to revitalize and strengthen rural community infrastructure by improving:  tourism-related events; trade shows; business meetings; training sessions; symposiums and conferences. This is done through the delivery of programs and initiatives such as the Business Development Program (BDP), the Regional Economic Growth Through Innovation Program (REGI), the Canadian Experiences Fund (CEF), the Canada Coal Transition Initiative (CCTI), the Economic Development Initiative (EDI), the Innovative Communities Fund (ICF) and the Atlantic Canada Tourism Partnership (ACTP).

ACOA also provides contributions to the Community Business Development Corporations (CBDCs) which are a network of community-based organizations that provide business loans, counselling and advice to SMEs and social enterprises in rural areas."
