serviceDescription: "To participate in the NEXUS Program, an applicant must submit, along with the requisite application fee, either an online application through the  new Trusted Traveller Programs Portal that is operated by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or a paper application to the CBSA, which will process the application through one of its Canadian Processing Centres (either in Montreal, QC, or Niagara Falls, ON). The application processing involves a risk assessment of the clients by both the US CBP and the CBSA to determine whether they meet the requirements to participate in the program, followed by an interview at an enrolment center by CBP and CBSA officers to finalize enrolment."
