serviceDescription: "This service provides businesses with the ability and authorization to electronically exchange commercial information with the CBSA's host system using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), either through the Customs Internet Gateway (CIG) or a Direct Connect (MQ Messaging). For those clients who do not wish to transmit electronic commerce data directly to the CBSA, there exist many third party service providers who currently transmit data to the CBSA on behalf of trade chain partners. Businesses and their service providers who choose to use one of the EDI options to transmit electronic commerce data must apply to the CBSA."
