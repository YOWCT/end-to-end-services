serviceDescription: "To participate in the FAST Program, an applicant must submit, along with the requisite application fee, either an online application through the new Trusted Traveller Programs Portal that is operated by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or a paper application to the CBSA, which will process the application through its Canadian Processing Centre in Niagara Falls, ON. Only drivers have to submit an application form and fees. Importers and carriers must be approved in the CSA program and must have signed a PIP memorandum of understanding to be eligible for FAST. The application processing involves a risk assessment of the applicant, carrier and importer by both the US CBP and the CBSA to determine whether they meet the requirements to participate in the program, followed by an interview at an enrolment center by CBP and CBSA officers to finalize enrolment."
