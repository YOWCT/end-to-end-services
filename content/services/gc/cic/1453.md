serviceDescription: "The Immigration Loans Program (ILP) provides eligible immigrants, who are mainly refugees selected for resettlement to Canada, with access to funding that would otherwise not be available to them. Loans are used to cover a number of expenses, including travel to Canada and other costs associated with resettlement, specifically: 
- defraying the cost of transportation to Canada (transportation loan);
- assisting with establishment in Canada (assistance loan);
- defraying the cost of the right of permanent residence fee (RPRF) loan.
  The loans are repayable in full and payment plans vary by the value of the loan.  Deferrals and extensions are available in some instances."
