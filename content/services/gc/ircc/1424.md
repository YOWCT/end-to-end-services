serviceDescription: "A visitor recordÂ  is a status document issued to a foreign national either at a port of entry by the Canada Border Services Agency or within Canada by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for a specified duration of stay.  If an officer believes that a foreign national's length of stay should be limited to a period of less than six months, or extended past  a period of six months, a visitor record is issued. Temporary residents can apply to extend their stay in Canada and if their application is approved then a Visitor Record will be issued."
