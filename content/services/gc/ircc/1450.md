serviceDescription: "The resettlement program plays an important role in Canada’s overall support for refugees. A reflection of Canada’s humanitarian tradition, the program enables refugees from around the world to come to Canada permanently. Refugees seeking resettlement to Canada must be referred by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) or be sponsored by a Canadian-based private group. IRCC resettles refugees through three streams: the Government-Assisted Refugees (GAR) program, the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program, and the Blended Visa-Office Referred (BVOR) program."
