serviceDescription: "BizPaL is an online service that benefits Canadian businesses by helping them identify which permits and licences they require and how to obtain them. Entrepreneurs simply select the business activities they plan to undertake and BizPaL then automatically generates a list of all required permits and licences from all levels of government (federal, provincial, territorial and municipal), along with basic information on each, and links to government sites where the entrepreneur can learn more and, in some cases, apply online. Each jurisdiction researches and inputs the permits and licences for the BizPaL service relevant to their level of government and has the option to either use the BizPaL interface or their own interface for the tool - using the BizPaL API."
